     *Demonstrated proficiency here: https://github.com/TechtonicGroup/HomeVestors_Selenium/blob/feature/Users_To_Pages_checks/SeleniumHVAGUI/SeleniumHVAGUI/AdminPeople.cs

- [x] While going through code, check the code formatting to improve readability and ensure there are no blockers

##### Architecture - *Summerize with example codebase (doesnt need to be yours but be able to explain)*

- [x] Separation of Concerns followed


- [x] Split into respective files (HTML, JavaScript and CSS)


- [x] Split into multiple layers and tiers as per requirements (Presentation, Business, and Data Layers)


- [x] Code is in sync with existing code patterns/technologies


- [x] Design patterns: Use appropriate design pattern (if if helps), after completely understanding the problem and context

##### Coding Best Practices - *Summerize*
	     Demonstrated proficiency here: https://github.com/TechtonicGroup/HomeVestors_Selenium/blob/feature/Users_To_Pages_checks/SeleniumHVAGUI/SeleniumHVAGUI/AdminPeople.cs

	
- [x] No hard coding, use constants/configuration values


- [x] Group similar values under an enumeration (enum)


- [x] Comments - Do not write comments for what you are doing, instead write comments on why you are doing. Specify about any hacks workaround and temporary fixes. Additionally mention pending tasks in your to-do comments, which can be tracked easily


- [x] Avoid multiple if/else blocks


- [x] Use framework features, wherever possible instead of writing custom code

##### Non Functional Requirements - *Summerize*

- [x] a.) Maintainability (Supportability) - The application should require the least amount of effort to support in the near future. It should be easy to identify, fix, and detect.

      EXAMPLE

      ​	Readability: Code should be self-explanatory. Get a feel of story reading. whlile going through code. Use appropriate name for variables, functions and classes. If you are taking more time to understand  the code, then either code needs refactoring or at least comments have to be written to make it clear.

      ​	Testability: The code should be easy to test. Refactor into separate function (if required). Use interfaces while talking to other layers, as interfaces can be mocked easily. Try to avoid static functions, singleton classes as these are not easily testable by mocks.

      ​	Debuggability: Provide support to log the flow of control, paramater data and exception details to find the root cause easily. if you are using Log4Net like component then add support for database logging also as querying the log table is easy.

      ​	Configurability: Keep the configurable values in place (XML file, database table) so that no code changes are required, if the data is changed frequently.


- [x] b.) Reusability - *Summerize*

      EXAMPLE

      ​	DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle: The same code should not be repeated more than twice

      ​	Consider reusable services, functions and components

      ​	Consider generic functions and classes


- [x] c.) Reliability - Exception handling and cleanup (dispose) resources. - *Summerize*



- [x] d.) Extensibility - Easy to add enhancements with minimal changes to existing code. One component should be easily replaceable by a better component. - *Summerize*



- [x] e.) Security - Authentication, authorization, input data validation against security threats such as SQL injections and Cross Site Scripting (XSS), encrypting the sensitive data (passwords, credit card information etc.) - *Summerize (This can be very high level)*



- [x] f.) Performance  - *Summerize*

      Use a data type that best suits the needs such as StringBuilder, generic collection classes - *Example*

      Lazy loading asynchronous and parallel processing - *Example*

      Caching and session/application data - *Summerize*

- [x] g.) Scalability - Consider if it supports a large user base/data? Can this be deployed into web farms? - *Summerize*



- [x] h.) Usability - Put yourself in the shoes of a end-user and ascertain, if the user interface/API is easy to understand and use. If you are not convinced with the user interface design, then start discussing your ideas with the business analyst - *Summerize*


##### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Principles - 
Learned through: https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design
Demonstrated proficiency here: https://github.com/TechtonicGroup/HomeVestors_Selenium/blob/feature/Users_To_Pages_checks/SeleniumHVAGUI/SeleniumHVAGUI/AdminPeople.cs,  
https://github.com/TechtonicGroup/HomeVestors_Selenium/blob/feature/Users_To_Pages_checks/SeleniumHVAGUI/SeleniumHVAGUI/Functions.cs


- [x] Single Responsibility Principle (SRS): Do not place more than one responsibility into a single class of function, refactor into separate classes and functions


- [x] Open Closed Principle: While adding new functionality, existing code should not be modified. New functionality should be written in new classes and functions


- [x] Liskov substitutability principle: The child class should not change the behavior (meaning) of the parent class. The child classcan be used as a substitute for a base class.
      - Completed Interface Polygons class


- [x] Interface segregation: Do not create lengthy interfaces, instead split them into smaller interfaces based on the functionality. The interface should not contain any dependencies (paramaters), which are not require for the expected functionality
      - Demonstrated in MVCMovie project: EXAMPLE Repo


- [x] Dependency Injection: Do not hardcode the dependencies, instead inject them
      - *Exposure to these concepts in MVVM example and summary*
